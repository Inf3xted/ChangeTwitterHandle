This script (wrote in Python 3.x.x.) allows you to change your Twitter source handle 

View my Twitter where I give proof of my new script working

# Please edit the script and add your keys

If you don't add the keys, your tweet won't be formatted correctly

Tutorial on how to make the custom handle

1. Make a Twitter account
2. Go to developer.twitter.com and make a developer account
3. Go to your Twitter username and hover over to see the "Apps" sub-menu and go ahead and click it
4. Here you'll be at the Twitter App creater (First time users will be at a setup screen)
5. The app name will be your Twitter Source Handle so choose it wisely
6. Put random letters in the description and put a url like a YouTube channel (can be any amount of subs)
7. MAKE SURE YOU PRESS "Enable Sign in with Twitter" VERY IMPORTANT
8. For the rest of the urls put the same link from before
9. Organization name is whatever you want
10. Put whatever you want for "Tell us how this app is used:" and hit create
11. Upon successful creation of the application, go to "Keys and Tokens"
12. Press "Create" where it says "Access token & access token secret"
13. Go to my script and edit the API keys and the Access tokens
14. Run the script, input Tweet and after 5 seconds refresh the page
15. Now you have the ability to change the Twitter Source Handle! Congrats
